#Here is the opening stanza of an important work of the English language:

#Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble
#I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
#Encrypt it, under the key "ICE", using repeating-key XOR.

#In repeating-key XOR, you'll sequentially apply each byte of the key; the first byte of plaintext will be XOR'd against I, the next C, the next E, then I again for the 4th byte, and so on.

#It should come out to:

#0b3637272a2b2e63622c2e69692a23693a2a3c6324202d623d63343c2a26226324272765272
